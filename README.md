# Systems-Programming
Project Assignments For CS214 at Rutgers Univserity

A collection of homework assignments written in C, where we learned about low level unix systems and how they work as the base for many of the applications we use today.

| Assignment | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |

| hw1        | A collection of small, programs written in C, which aim to teach the basics of Programming in C on a Unix system, such a creating a factor program, creating a terminal                  game, etc. |
| hw2        | Another collection of programs, this time aiming to replicate the Unix built in commands in C, mainly `ls`, `find`, and `tree`. |
| hw3        | A step up from the previous assignments, this one required us to build a Unix shell in which we managed multiple processes, built a job system, and extensively learned                  about signals. |
| hw4        | For this assignment, we were tasked with replicating the core parts of the malloc library, in which we had to use memory and pointer management. |
| hw5        | The final project, tasked us with taking a simple single-player game written with SDL, and convert it into a multiplayer project, playable across multiple computers of                  the same network. |
